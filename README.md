How can understanding your audienceâ€™s expertise level (tech experts vs. regular folks) shape the way you present technical information?
Language and terminology- for tech experts you'll use precise technical terms while for regular folks you'll explain terms in simple, relatable ways.
Depth of explanation- for tech experts you'll dive deep into technical details, focusing on advanced use cases while for regular folks you'll stick to high level concepts.
Use of analogies and examples- for tech experts you'll use real-world coding examples while for regular folks you'll use everyday analogies
Format and structure- for tech experts you'll use documentations while for regular folks you'll use visulas, step by step guides and interactive demonstrations.

What are some strategies to tailor your content to different audience types?

Visuals and examples increase retention- people remember 65% of visual content compared to only 10% of what they read alone.

What types of visuals (e.g., diagrams, charts) are most effective for different kinds of technical information?
Flowchart,process diagram- effective for process or workflow.
Bar chart, line chart, table- effective for data comparisons
Line chart- effective for trends over time.
Table- feature comparisons
Architecture diagram- system architecture

How do headings and subheadings improve the readability and organization of technical documents?
